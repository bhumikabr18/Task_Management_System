# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Task_Management_System

# Overview
The Task Management System is a simple web application that allows users to add and delete tasks. The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, while the frontend is developed with React.js. The API is tested using Postman, and all tasks can be retrieved using the GET method.

# Features
✅ Add Tasks – Users can create tasks.
<br>
✅ Delete Tasks – Users can remove tasks.
<br>
✅ Retrieve Tasks – View all tasks using a GET request.
<br>
✅ RESTful API – Backend APIs built with Express.js.
<br>
✅ Postman Testing – API endpoints tested via Postman.

# Tech Stack
🔹 Front-End: React.js, Redux
<br>
🔹 Back-End: Node.js, Express.js
<br>
🔹 Database: MongoDB
<br>
🔹 API Testing: Postman

# Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed.

# Run the Application

## Start the Backend Server
cd backend
<br>
node server.js
<br>

## Start the Frontend
cd frontend
<br>
npm start

# API Testing (Using Postman)
- GET /tasks – Retrieve all tasks
- POST /tasks – Add a new task
- DELETE /tasks/:id – Remove a task

# Future Enhancements
🚀 Authentication & Authorization – Implement JWT authentication.
<br>
🚀 Task Status Updates – Allow users to mark tasks as completed.
<br>
🚀 UI Improvements – Enhance the frontend with better design and UX.
